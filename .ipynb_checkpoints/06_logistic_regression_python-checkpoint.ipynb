This time, instead of taking gradient descent steps, you will use the [`scipy.optimize` module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html). SciPy is a numerical computing library for `python`. It provides an optimization module for root finding and minimization. As of `scipy 1.0`, the function `scipy.optimize.minimize` is the method to use for optimization problems(both constrained and unconstrained).\n",
